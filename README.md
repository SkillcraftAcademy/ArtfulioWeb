1. **Install Composer**: Symfony uses Composer to manage its dependencies. Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. You can install Composer globally on your system by following the instructions on [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**: Move into your newly created project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Artfulio
    ```

3. **Run `composer update`**: Before proceeding, it's a good practice to ensure that all dependencies are up to date. Run the following command to update your project's dependencies:

    ```bash
    composer update
    ```

4. **Run the Symfony Development Server**: Symfony provides a built-in web server for development purposes. You can start it by running the following command:

    ```bash
    symfony server:start
    ```

    This will start the Symfony web server, and you should see output indicating that the server is running and which address it's listening on.

5. **Access Your Application**: Once the server is running, open a web browser and navigate to the address where Symfony is serving your application. By default, it should be `http://localhost:8000`.

6. **Create the Database Schema with Doctrine**: If you're using an ORM like Doctrine to manage your database, you'll need to create the database schema. Run the following commands in your project directory:

    ```bash
    php bin/console doctrine:database:create
    php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
    ```

    The first command creates the database based on your Symfony configuration, and the second command updates the database schema based on your entity definitions.

That's it! You've successfully started a new Symfony project, updated dependencies, and created your database schema. You're now ready to begin building your web application. If you encounter any issues or have questions along the way, don't hesitate to consult the Symfony documentation or search for solutions online.
